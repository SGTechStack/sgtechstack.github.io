Welcome to the App Framework Documentation Playbook! This playbook serves as your comprehensive guide to utilizing our Starter Kit, a comprehensive toolkit that aims to accelerate your development process while using Spring Boot for the backend and React for the frontend.

The Starter Kit is meticulously designed to provide you with a comprehensive set of custom libraries, packages, frameworks, and templates. By leveraging these resources, you can streamline your development process and significantly enhance productivity. We understand the challenges faced by developers when starting a new project, and our Starter Kit is tailored to address these challenges head-on. Throughout this documentation playbook, we will delve into the various aspects of our Starter Kit, from setting up the development environment to exploring the custom libraries and templates.

Our Starter Kit includes a sample app that serves as a baseline code, pre-configured with our custom library packages and frameworks. You have the flexibility to either start your development journey from scratch or utilize the sample app as a solid foundation for your project. Regardless of your choice, the Starter Kit is designed to provide you with a productive and efficient development experience.
