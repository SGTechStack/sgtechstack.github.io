# Overview

The Pagination-Query React library simplifies backend pagination queries in React applications by providing an abstraction layer on top of the `@tanstack/react-query` library. It seamlessly integrates with `@tanstack/react-query` and `axios` for efficient backend calls, managing page numbers, sizes and sorting.

```
npm install @eds-component/pagination-query

1. `react`
2. `react-dom`
